title: From Squeezebox to SONOS
---

After using Squeezebox/Logitech Media Server for 10 years, I finally gave up. It was never easy to use, but my hardware has gotten cantankerous and the software isn't great any more. While there is still at stoic community continuing development, I just want something that works and maintained by a company with a dedicated revenue stream. And i'm willing to pay for it.

Seems like it's not much to ask? Over a decade after Squeezebox did basically everything I wanted - I figured the technlogy should be far superior now. 

How wrong I was.

This blog is meant to help others trying to find a great solution - perhaps coming from Squeezebox too - make head or tail of the options.

I have a SONOS now, after evaluating a lot of other hardware. It's great in many ways but not perfect, and still requires dealing with 3rd party software to manage my large music library.
