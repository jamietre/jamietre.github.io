This page is a summary of technology (hardware, software) that might be part of the perfect streaming media system. This will be roughly organized by hardware platform, then within that, things that support using that platform.

###SONOS 

######Pros

* Large user base, well-established product
* Integrated app supporting all music sources

#####Cons

* Missing some important features from Spotify support & no Spotify Connect option
* Expensive hardware
* 65,000 file limit for your own library

####Subsonic

* Media Server
* Quasi-commerical ("pro" license required for SONOS integration)
* Development pace seems lackluster, though SONOS support is relatively new.

Decent SONOS integration as an app, though server has limited ability to use tags. I'm using this now. Other benefits include a pretty good app ecosystem for remote access from other devices like your mobile phone. 

####Madsonic

* Subsonic fork
* A "6.0" version is in development
* Current state is uncertain - there have been recent updates on the product's forum, but the update has been promised for a very long time.
* SONOS support in beta only

####[Asset UPNP](https://www.dbpoweramp.com/asset-upnp-dlna.htm) 

* Media server
* Commercial Software
